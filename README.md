# data-sci-mach-learn
Data science and machine learning project notebooks. 
Here we present the notebooks related to my data science and machine learning projects.  
The topics analyzed here are:
- Drugs decision for the doctor. 
- Churn of the costumers.
- Movies decision for clients. 
- Weather Station.
- Vehicle efficiency. 
- Decisions between services for a Telecommunications provider.
- CO2 emissions.
- Cancer tumors decision.
- Characterization of the flower species.

The Machine Learning algorithms during the projects used were:

- Decision-Trees.
- Linear Regression.
- Multi Linear Regression.
- Logistic Regression.
- Polynomial Regression.
- Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.
- Collaborative filtering.
- Hierarchical Clustering.
- K-Nearest Neighbors.
- Support Vector Machines.
